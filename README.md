This project creates a website with several recipe pages that can be 
accessed from the homepage. This project demonstrates basic
HTML skills, including creating a boilerplate, formatting text,
creating lists, adding images, and linking other pages. It also
demonstrates organization skills in the form of properly organizing
the website directory. Finally, this project demonstrates usage of the
DVCS software known as Git.
