            <li>2.5 cups crushed chocolate cream-filled sandwich cookies (such as OREO® Cookies)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup butter, melted</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped pecans</li>
            <li>1/2 cup flaked coconut</li>
            <li>4 (8 oz) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup custard powder (such as Bird's® Custard Powder)</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>6 (1 oz) squares semisweet chocolate</li>
            <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <p><li>Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li></p>
            <p><li>Stir together the cookie crumbs, melted butter, pecans, and coconut in a bowl
                until the mixture is well combined. Press into the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking
                dish, and refrigerate while making filling.</li></p>
            <p><li>Beat cream cheese, sugar, and custard powder in a large bowl with an electric
                mixer until light and fluffy, and beat in eggs, 1 at a time, beating each until
                fully incorporated before adding the next. Layer the filling over the crust.</li></p>
            <p><li>Bake in the preheated oven until the center is almost set, about 40 minutes.
                Refrigerate the cheesecake until fully cold, at least 3 hours.</li></p>
            <p><li>Melt the semisweet chocolate in a saucepan over very low heat with the cream,
                and stir until the mixture is smooth and well blended. Pour the chocolate mixture
                over the cheesecake, spread with a spatula to cover the middle layer, and
                refrigerate until the topping is firm, 15 to 20 minutes. Serve cold. Store
                leftovers in refrigerator.</li></p>
        </ol>
